TITLE: CORS – Full Explanation (Why Everything Broke)

CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

THE PROBLEM:
Browsers block requests when:
- Frontend and backend use different ports
- Or different domains

Example:
React → localhost:3001
Laravel → 127.0.0.1:8000

Browser says:
"I don’t trust this request unless backend allows it."

THIS IS NOT A LARAVEL BUG.
THIS IS BROWSER SECURITY.

LARAVEL 12 IMPORTANT NOTE:
cors.php is NOT created by default.

STEP 1: Publish CORS config
Command:
php artisan config:publish cors

STEP 2: Edit file
cinema-api/config/cors.php

allowed_origins => [
  'http://localhost:3000',
  'http://localhost:3001',
]

STEP 3: Clear config cache
Command:
php artisan optimize:clear

WHY CACHE CLEAR IS REQUIRED:
Laravel caches config for performance.
Changes do NOTHING until cache is cleared.
