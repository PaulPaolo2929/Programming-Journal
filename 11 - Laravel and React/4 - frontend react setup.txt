TITLE: React Frontend Setup (Detailed Explanation)

STEP 1: Create React app
Command:
npx create-react-app cinema-frontend

WHY:
This creates:
- Webpack config
- React scripts
- Dev server
- Folder structure

STEP 2: Enter project
Command:
cd cinema-frontend

STEP 3: Install Axios
Command:
npm install axios

WHY:
React does NOT have a built-in HTTP client.
Axios is used to make API requests to Laravel.

STEP 4: Start React server
Command:
npm start

RESULT:
React runs on:
http://localhost:3000
OR
http://localhost:3001 (if 3000 is busy)

IMPORTANT:
React port can change.
Laravel must allow that port via CORS.
