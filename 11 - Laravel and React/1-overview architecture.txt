TITLE: Understanding the System (Mental Model)

This project is a FULL-STACK APPLICATION using TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS.

1) Laravel (Backend)
2) React (Frontend)

They are NOT the same thing.
They do NOT run together.
They do NOT share files.

Laravel:
- Runs on PHP
- Handles database, business logic, API endpoints
- Returns data as JSON
- Does NOT render HTML pages for users

React:
- Runs in the browser
- Handles UI, buttons, pages, interaction
- Does NOT talk to the database directly
- Requests data from Laravel using HTTP

IMPORTANT IDEA:
React NEVER touches the database.
Laravel NEVER controls the UI.

They communicate ONLY through HTTP requests.
