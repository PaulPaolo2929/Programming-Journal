TITLE: Laravel Backend Setup (Detailed Explanation)

STEP 1: Install dependencies
Command:
composer install

WHY:
Laravel uses Composer to install PHP libraries.
Without this, the project cannot run.

STEP 2: Environment configuration (.env)
The .env file stores environment-specific settings:
- Database name
- App URL
- Debug mode

Example:
APP_URL=http://localhost
DB_DATABASE=cinema_db

WHY:
Laravel reads this file to know how to connect to the database.

STEP 3: Database migration
Command:
php artisan migrate

WHY:
This creates tables in the database.
Without migrations, APIs may work but return empty data.

STEP 4: Start Laravel server
Command:
php artisan serve

RESULT:
Laravel runs on:
http://127.0.0.1:8000

STEP 5: Test API directly
Open browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/movies

WHY:
Always test backend FIRST.
If this fails, React will NEVER work.
This ensures the backend is functioning before integrating with the frontend.
